# Workstation

An experiment to automate the setup of my dev machine from a fresh ubuntu, while learning Ansible.

## Features:

* Install and update system packages from a list
* Install ruby versions from a list with rbenv and ruby-build
* Install and configure fish shell
* Install node versions from a list with [fnm](https://github.com/fisherman/fnm)

## Usage

...

## TODO

* document ansible config and playbook execution on localhost
* install android + cordova to build hybrid apps
* sync dotfiles for tmux, vim, fish, ...
* install custom inconsolata font
* clone remote git repos from a list of current projects
